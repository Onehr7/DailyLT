  ```python
  class Solution:
      def minElements(self, nums: List[int], limit: int, goal: int) -> int:
          sum_nums = sum(nums)
          diff = abs(goal - sum_nums)
  
          if diff % limit == 0:
              return diff // limit
          else:
              return diff // limit + 1
  ```

  

+ Golang

  ```go
  func minElements(nums []int, limit int, goal int) int {
  	sum := 0
  	for _, num := range nums {
  		sum += num
  	}
  
  	diff := sum - goal
  
  	if diff < 0 {
  		diff = -diff
  	}
  
  	if diff%limit == 0 {
  		return diff / limit
  	} else {
  		return diff/limit + 1
  	}
  
  }
  ```
